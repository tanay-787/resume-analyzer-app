## About the Project
The Resume Analyzer App is a web application that helps users analyze and improve their resumes. The app provides insights on various aspects of the resume and suggests improvements to make it more appealing to recruiters.

## Built With
This project is built using the following technologies:
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **SCSS**: A CSS preprocessor that adds special features such as variables and nested rules.
- **HTML**: The standard markup language for creating web pages.
